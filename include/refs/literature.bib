@article{Orus14,
abstract = {This is a partly non-technical introduction to selected topics on tensor network methods, based on several lectures and introductory seminars given on the subject. It should be a good place for newcomers to get familiarized with some of the key ideas in the field, specially regarding the numerics. After a very general introduction we motivate the concept of tensor network and provide several examples. We then move on to explain some basics about Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). Selected details on some of the associated numerical methods for 1. d and 2. d quantum lattice systems are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Vidal04,
abstract = {We present a numerical method to simulate the time evolution, according to a generic Hamiltonian made of local interactions, of quantum spin chains and systems alike. The efficiency of the scheme depends on the amount of entanglement involved in the simulated evolution. Numerical analysis indicates that this method can be used, for instance, to efficiently compute time-dependent properties of low-energy dynamics in sufficiently regular but otherwise arbitrary one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. As by-products, we describe two alternatives to the density matrix renormalization group method.},

@article{Schollwoeck11,
abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

@article{BrEA13,
abstract = {In this article, we discuss the development and evaluation of a game designed to harness non-expert human intuition for scientific research in the field of Quantum Physics (Quantum Information). Since many physics problems are represented and analysed in a geometric space, we hypothesized that human predispositions such as geo-spatial intuition could be considered as a means to reduce the search space in some optimisation problems in quantum information which are currently solved through brute force approaches. We developed a 3D digital game in order to investigate players' ability to solve a known and quantifiable current research problem in quantum physics. In this article, we describe our motivations for conducting this work, the game design and its implementation, our experimental design and an analysis of the results obtained via player evaluation. Initial results are promising, indicating that players can indeed find known solutions to the example problem.},

@article{HPCP09,
abstract = {In some cases the state of a quantum system with a large number of subsystems can be approximated efficiently by the density-matrix renormalization group, which makes use of redundancies in the description of the state. Here we show that the achievable efficiency can be much better when performing density-matrix renormalization group calculations in the Heisenberg picture, as only the observable of interest but not the entire state is considered. In some nontrivial cases, this approach can even be exact for finite bond dimensions.},
