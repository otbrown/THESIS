abstract = {Fundamental conceptual problems that arise from the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of the second law of thermodynamics are considered. It is shown that nonequilibrium may become a source of order and that irreversible processes may lead to a new type of dynamic states of matter called "dissipative structures." The thermodynamic theory of such structures is outlined. A microscopic definition of irreversible processes is given, and a transformation theory is developed that allows one to introduce nonunitary equations of motion that explicitly display irreversibility and approach to thermodynamic equilibrium. The work of the group at the University of Brussels in these fields is briefly reviewed. In this new development of theoretical chemistry and physics, it is likely that thermodynamic concepts will play an ever increasing role},

abstract = {We explore theoretically the nonequilibrium photonic phases of an array of coupled cavities in presence of incoherent driving and dissipation. In particular, we consider a Hubbard model system where each site is a Kerr nonlinear resonator coupled to a two-level emitter, which is pumped incoherently. Within a Gutzwiller mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of such a system. We find that, at a critical value of the inter-cavity photon hopping rate, a second-order nonequilibrium phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the {\$}U(1){\$} symmetry occurs. The transition from an incompressible Mott-like photon fluid to a coherent delocalized phase is driven by commensurability effects and not by the competition between photon hopping and optical nonlinearity. The essence of the mean-field predictions is corroborated by finite-size simulations obtained with matrix product operators and corner-space renormalization methods.},

abstract = {Spontaneous emission of radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms by which an excited quantum system returns to equilibrium. For spins, however, spontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative relaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole and the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous emission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a resonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the lifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or optical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first application of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in silicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small mode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission constitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is increased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity resonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled on-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin systems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and quantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the electromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work represents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of individual spins to microwave photons.},

abstract = {This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in the fundamental understanding and active control of quantum fluids of light in nonlinear optical systems. In the presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically nonequilibrium nature. A rich variety of recently observed photon hydrodynamical effects is presented, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While the review is mostly focused on a specific class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of the article is devoted to a review of the future perspectives in the direction of strongly correlated photon gases and of artificial gauge fields for photons. In particular, several mechanisms to obtain efficient photon blockade are presented, together with their application to the generation of novel quantum phases.},

Within the mean-field approximation, we demonstrate that one of these parameters decreases the size of the Mott lobes in the phase diagram. By considering also Gaussian fluctuations, we show that the coupling with the dye molecules results in a finite lifetime of the quasiparticle and quasihole excitations in the Mott lobes. Moreover, we show that there are number fluctuations in the Mott lobes even at zero temperature and therefore that the true Mott-insulating state never exists if the interactions with the dye are included.},

This phase corresponds to a Bose condensate of cavity polaritons, generalized to allow for the fermionic internal structure of the excitons. It is separated from the normal state by an unusual reentrant phase boundary. We calculate the excitation energies of the model, and hence the optical absorption spectra of the cavity. In the condensed phase the absorption spectrum is gapped. The presence of this gap distinguishes the polariton condensate from the normal state and from a conventional laser, even when the inhomogeneous linewidth of the excitons is so large that there is no observable polariton splitting in the normal state.},

Generically, the superfluid onset transition in d dimensions from a Mott insulator to superfluidity is ‘‘ideal,'' or mean field in character, but at special multicritical points with particle-hole symmetry it is in the universality class of the (d+1)-dimensional XY model.

Here we describe an optical system that exhibits strongly correlated dynamics on a mesoscopic scale. By adding photons to a two-dimensional array of coupled optical cavities each containing a single two-level atom in the photon-blockade regime, we form dressed states, or polaritons, that are both long-lived and strongly interacting. Our results predict that at zero temperature the system will undergo a characteristic Mott insulator (excitations localized on each site) to superfluid (excitations delocalized across the lattice) quantum phase transition. Moreover, the ability to couple light to and from individual cavities of this system could be useful in the realization of tuneable quantum simulators and other quantum-mechanical devices.},

Rather than a Suzuki-Trotter splitting of the Hamiltonian, which is the idea behind the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method or time-evolving block decimation, our method is based on splitting the projector onto the matrix product state tangent space as it appears in the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. We discuss how the resulting algorithm resembles the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finding ground states so closely that it can be implemented by changing just a few lines of code and it inherits the same stability and efficiency. In particular, our method is compatible with any Hamiltonian for which DMRG can be implemented efficiently and DMRG is obtained as a special case of imaginary time evolution with infinite time step.},

Here we show how a direct modification of the system-bath coupling via parametric oscillation creates an effective chemical potential for photons even in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show that the photonic system equilibrates to the temperature of the bath, with a tunable chemical potential that is set by the frequency of the parametric coupler. Specific implementations, using circuit-QED or optomechanics, are feasible using current technologies, and we show a detailed example demonstrating the emergence of Mott insulator–superfluid transition in a lattice of nonlinear oscillators.

Light with nonzero chemical potential is produced in photochemical reactions, for example, in a light emitting diode. The chemical potential of black-body radiation becomes negative upon a Joule expansion. The isothermal diffusion of light, which is a common phenomenon, is driven by the gradient in the chemical potential.

Because thequantum‘particles' in these simulators are circuit excitations rather than physical particles subject to conservation laws, superconducting simulators provide a complement to ultracold atoms by naturally accessing non-equilibrium physics.

To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

The main effect of the nonlinear couplings is to provide an effective cross-Kerr interaction between nearest-neighbor cavities. Additionally correlated photon hopping between neighboring cavities arises. We provide a detailed mean-field analysis of the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the system parameters, the leakage and the external driving, and show the emergence of a number of different quantum phases. A photon crystal associated to a spatial modulation of the photon blockade appears. The steady state can also display oscillating behavior and bi-stability. In some regions the crystalline ordering may coexist with the oscillating behavior. Furthermore we study the effect of short-range quantum fluctuations by employing a cluster mean-field analysis. Focusing on the corrections to the photon crystal boundaries, we show that, apart for some quantitative differences, the cluster mean field supports the findings of the simple single-site analysis. In the last part of the paper we concentrate on the possibility to build up the class of arrays introduced here, by means of superconducting circuits of existing technology. We consider a realistic choice of the parameters for this specific implementation and discuss some properties of the steady-state phase diagram.},

abstract = {Phase transitions to quantum condensed phases--such as Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), superfluidity, and superconductivity--have long fascinated scientists, as they bring pure quantum effects to a macroscopic scale. BEC has, for example, famously been demonstrated in dilute atom gas of rubidium atoms at temperatures below 200 nanokelvin. Much effort has been devoted to finding a solid-state system in which BEC can take place. Promising candidate systems are semiconductor microcavities, in which photons are confined and strongly coupled to electronic excitations, leading to the creation of exciton polaritons. These bosonic quasi-particles are 10(9) times lighter than rubidium atoms, thus theoretically permitting BEC to occur at standard cryogenic temperatures. Here we detail a comprehensive set of experiments giving compelling evidence for BEC of polaritons. Above a critical density, we observe massive occupation of the ground state developing from a polariton gas at thermal equilibrium at 19 K, an increase of temporal coherence, and the build-up of long-range spatial coherence and linear polarization, all of which indicate the spontaneous onset of a macroscopic quantum phase.},

The scheme is predicted to stabilize a non-equilibrium steady state sharing important features with a zero-temperature equilibrium state with a tunable chemical potential. We confirm this for the Bose-Hubbard model by computing numerically the steady state for finite system sizes: first, we predict the existence of an incompressible Mott-Insulator-like state, which is robust against tunneling and losses, with an arbitrary integer density. Secondly for non-integer densities or stronger tunneling, the system enters a coherent regime analogous to the superfluid state. Specific features related to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state are pointed out.},

Taking inspiration from forced evaporation in cold-atom experiments, the essential ingredients for our low-entropy thermal reservoir are (a) inter-particle interactions, and (b) energy-dependent loss. The resulting thermal reservoir may then be coupled to a broad class of Hamiltonian systems to produce low-entropy quantum phases. We present an ide-alized picture of such a reservoir, deriving the scaling of reservoir entropy with system parameters, and then propose several practical implementations using only standard circuit quantum electrody-namics tools, and extract the fundamental performance limits. Finally, we explore, both analytically and numerically, the coupling of such a thermalizer to the paradigmatic Bose-Hubbard chain, where we employ it to stabilize an n = 1 Mott phase. In this case, the performance is limited by the in-terplay of dynamically arrested thermalization of the Mott insulator and finite heat capacity of the thermalizer, characterized by its repumping rate. This work explores a new approach to preparation of quantum phases of strongly interacting photons, and provides a potential route to topologically protected phases that are difficult to reach through adiabatic evolution.},

abstract = {Light is treated as heat in traditional thermodynamics. Photons are assigned a temperature but zero chemical potential. In processes such as photovoltaic or photochemical absorption, electroluminescence and chemiluminescence, the number of photons is related to that of other energy quanta, e.g. electron-hole pairs or chemical excitations. This leads to a non-zero chemical potential of photons allowing the treatment of these processes by analogy with ordinary chemistry: equilibrium is reached when the sum of the chemical potentials, including that of photons, is zero. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {We study an array of dissipative tunnel-coupled cavities, each interacting with an incoherently pumped two-level emitter. For cavities in the lasing regime, we find correlations between the light fields of distant cavities, despite the dissipation and the incoherent nature of the pumping mechanism. These correlations decay exponentially with distance for arrays in any dimension but become increasingly long ranged with increasing photon tunneling between adjacent cavities. The interaction-dominated and the tunneling-dominated regimes show markedly different scaling of the correlation length which always remains finite due to the finite photon trapping time. We propose a series of observables to characterize the spontaneous build-up of collective coherence in the system.},

The quadratic driving term does not lift the original {\$}U(1){\$} symmetry completely and a discrete {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}2{\$} symmetry is left. A mean-field analysis of the steady state reveals a second-order phase transition from a symmetric phase to a quasi-coherent state with a finite expectation value of the Bose field.

abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Quantum gases of atoms and exciton-polaritons are now well-established theoretical and experimental tools for fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics and suggest promising applications to quantum computing. Given their technological complexity, it is of paramount interest to devise other systems where such quantum many-body physics can be investigated at lesser technological expense. Here we examine a relatively well-known system of laser light propagating through thermo-optical defocusing media: based on a hydrodynamic description of light as a quantum fluid of interacting photons, we investigate such systems as a valid room-temperature alternative to atomic or exciton–polariton condensates for studies of many-body physics. First, we show that by using a technique traditionally used in oceanography it is possible to perform a direct measurement of the single-particle part of the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations on top of the photon fluid and to detect its global flow. Then, using a pump-and-probe setup, we investigate the dispersion of excitation modes of the fluid: for very long wavelengths, a sonic, dispersionless propagation is observed that we interpret as a signature of superfluid behavior.},

The difference between thermal and non-thermal radiation is accounted for by introducing the chemical potential of photons. Instead of an effective temperature all kinds of radiation have the real temperature of the emitting material. As a result Planck's law for thermal radiation is extended to radiation of any kind. The concept of the chemical potential of radiation is discussed in detail in conjunction with light-emitting diodes, two-level systems, and lasers. It allows the calculation of absorption coefficients, of emission spectra of luminescent materials, and of radiative recombination lifetimes of electrons and holes in semiconductors. Theoretical emission spectra are compared with experimental data on GaAs light-emitting diodes and excellent agreement is obtained.},

abstract = {The peculiarities in the Bose-Einstein condensation of particles and quasiparticles are discussed. The difference between the condensation of conserved and unconserved particles is analyzed. A classification of quasiparticles is given. The emphasis is made on the ability of particles and quasiparticles to condense. Illustrations include: general Bose-condensed atomic systems, such as ensembles of trapped atoms, Bose gases with conserved and unconserved number of atoms, vibrating atoms in double-well lattices, Holstein-Primakoff magnons, Schwinger bosons, slave bosons, and the condensation of singletons and triplons. The basic difference is that the system of particles, whose total number is conserved, can form equilibrium as well as nonequilibrium condensates, while unconserved particles can condense only in a nonequilibrium system subject to external pumping supporting the density of these particles sufficient for their condensation. The examples of such a nonequilibrium condensation of unconserved particles are the Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons, polaritons, and photons. Elementary collective excitations, such as bogolons and phonons, being self-consistently defined, do not condense. Magnons cannot condense in equilibrium systems. Controversies, existing in literature with regard to the Bose-Einstein condensation of some quasiparticles, are explained. Pushing a system out of equilibrium may favor the condensation of unconserved quasiparticles, but suppresses the condensate fraction of conserved particles.},

In the effectively one-dimensional representation of a system by matrix product states, long-ranged interactions are necessary to simulate not just many physical interactions but also higher-dimensional problems with short-ranged interactions. Since our method overcomes the restriction to short-ranged Hamiltonians of most existing methods, it proves particularly useful for studying the dynamics of both power-law interacting one-dimensional systems, such as Coulombic and dipolar systems, and quasi two-dimensional systems, such as strips or cylinders. First, we benchmark the method by verifying a long-standing theoretical prediction for the dynamical correlation functions of the Haldane-Shastry model. Second, we simulate the time evolution of an expanding cloud of particles in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a subject of several recent experiments.},
