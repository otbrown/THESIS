abstract = {Fundamental conceptual problems that arise from the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of the second law of thermodynamics are considered. It is shown that nonequilibrium may become a source of order and that irreversible processes may lead to a new type of dynamic states of matter called "dissipative structures." The thermodynamic theory of such structures is outlined. A microscopic definition of irreversible processes is given, and a transformation theory is developed that allows one to introduce nonunitary equations of motion that explicitly display irreversibility and approach to thermodynamic equilibrium. The work of the group at the University of Brussels in these fields is briefly reviewed. In this new development of theoretical chemistry and physics, it is likely that thermodynamic concepts will play an ever increasing role},

Generically, the superfluid onset transition in d dimensions from a Mott insulator to superfluidity is ‘‘ideal,'' or mean field in character, but at special multicritical points with particle-hole symmetry it is in the universality class of the (d+1)-dimensional XY model. In the presence of disorder, a third, ‘‘Bose glass'' phase exists. This phase is insulating because of the localization effects of the randomness and analogous to the Fermi glass phase of interacting fermions in a strongly disordered potential.},

Rather than a Suzuki-Trotter splitting of the Hamiltonian, which is the idea behind the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method or time-evolving block decimation, our method is based on splitting the projector onto the matrix product state tangent space as it appears in the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. We discuss how the resulting algorithm resembles the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finding ground states so closely that it can be implemented by changing just a few lines of code and it inherits the same stability and efficiency. In particular, our method is compatible with any Hamiltonian for which DMRG can be implemented efficiently and DMRG is obtained as a special case of imaginary time evolution with infinite time step.},

Consequently, for the thermodynamics of photons, while we have a concept of temperature for energy conservation, there is no equivalent chemical potential for particle number conservation. However, the notion of a chemical potential is crucial in understanding a wide variety of single- and many-body effects, from transport in conductors and semiconductors to phase transitions in electronic and atomic systems. Here we show how a direct modification of the system-bath coupling via parametric oscillation creates an effective chemical potential for photons even in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show that the photonic system equilibrates to the temperature of the bath, with a tunable chemical potential that is set by the frequency of the parametric coupler. Specific implementations, using circuit-QED or optomechanics, are feasible using current technologies, and we show a detailed example demonstrating the emergence of Mott insulator–superfluid transition in a lattice of nonlinear oscillators. Our approach paves the way for quantum simulation, quantum sources, and even electronlike circuits with light.},

Substantial progress to overcome these problems has been achieved with cold atoms in optical lattices, where a detailed control of collective properties is feasible but it is very difficult to address and hence control or measure individual sites. Here we show, that polaritons, combined atom and photon excitations, in an array of cavities such as a photonic crystal or coupled toroidal micro-cavities, can form a strongly interacting many body system, where individual particles can be controlled and measured. All individual building blocks of the proposed setting have already been experimentally realised, thus demonstrating the potential of this device as a quantum simulator.

Starting from a strictly local interaction the projection gives rise to effective long-range terms stabilizing a supersolid phase at densities above nu{\_}c=1/9 of the kagome lattice. In the sawtooth lattice on the other hand we show that the solid order, which exists at the magic filling nu{\_}c=1/4, is unstable to further doping. The universal low-energy properties at filling 1/4+delta nu are described by the well known commensurate-incommensurate transition. We support the analytic results by detailed numerical calculations using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group and exact diagonalization. Finally, we discuss possible realizations of the models using ultracold atoms as well as frustrated quantum magnets in high magnetic fields. We compute the momentum distribution and the noise correlations, that can be extracted from time of flight experiments or neutron scattering, and point to signatures of the unique supersolid phase of the kagome lattice.},

We confirm the efficiency of our proposal for the Bose-Hubbard model by computing numerically the steady state for finite system sizes: first, we predict the occurrence of a sequence of incompressible Mott-Insulator-like states with arbitrary integer densities presenting strong robustness against tunneling and losses. Secondly, for stronger tunneling amplitudes or non-integer densities, the system enters a coherent regime analogous to the superfluid state. In addition to an overall agreement with the zero-temperature equilibrium state, exotic non-equilibrium processes leading to a finite entropy generation are pointed out in specific regions of parameter space. The equilibrium ground state is shown to be recovered by adding frequency-dependent losses. The promise of this improved scheme in view of quantum simulation of the zero temperature many-body physics is highlighted.},

Even in the metallic limit, serious deviations from the Boltzmann transport theory and Fermi-liquid theory have been predicted and observed experimentally. There are two important ingredients in this new understanding: the concept of Anderson localization and the effects of interaction between electrons in a disordered medium. This paper emphasizes the theoretical aspect, even though some of the relevant experiments are also examined. The bulk of the paper focuses on the metallic side, but the authors also discuss the metal-to-insulator transition and comment on problems associated with the insulator.},

abstract = {We suggest a simple approach to populate photonic quantum materials at non-zero chemical potential and near-zero temperature. Taking inspiration from forced evaporation in cold-atom experiments, the essential ingredients for our low-entropy thermal reservoir are (a) inter-particle interactions, and (b) energy-dependent loss. The resulting thermal reservoir may then be coupled to a broad class of Hamiltonian systems to produce low-entropy quantum phases. We present an ide-alized picture of such a reservoir, deriving the scaling of reservoir entropy with system parameters, and then propose several practical implementations using only standard circuit quantum electrody-namics tools, and extract the fundamental performance limits. Finally, we explore, both analytically and numerically, the coupling of such a thermalizer to the paradigmatic Bose-Hubbard chain, where we employ it to stabilize an n = 1 Mott phase. In this case, the performance is limited by the in-terplay of dynamically arrested thermalization of the Mott insulator and finite heat capacity of the thermalizer, characterized by its repumping rate. This work explores a new approach to preparation of quantum phases of strongly interacting photons, and provides a potential route to topologically protected phases that are difficult to reach through adiabatic evolution.},

The derivation of fusion, cancellation and abide laws from the biproduct equations makes it easy to calculate algorithms implementing matrix multiplication, the central operation of matrix algebra, ranging from its divide-and-conquer version to its vectorization implementation. From errant attempts to learn how particular products and coproducts emerge from biproducts, not only blocked matrix algebra is rediscovered but also a way of extending other operations (e.g. Gaussian elimination) blockwise, in a calculational style, is found.

abstract = {Superconducting circuits are promising candidates for constructing quantum bits (qubits) in a quantum computer; single-qubit operations are now routine, and several examples of two qubit interactions and gates having been demonstrated. These experiments show that two nearby qubits can be readily coupled with local interactions. Performing gates between an arbitrary pair of distant qubits is highly desirable for any quantum computer architecture, but has not yet been demonstrated. An efficient way to achieve this goal is to couple the qubits to a quantum bus, which distributes quantum information among the qubits. Here we show the implementation of such a quantum bus, using microwave photons confined in a transmission line cavity, to couple two superconducting qubits on opposite sides of a chip. The interaction is mediated by the exchange of virtual rather than real photons, avoiding cavity induced loss. Using fast control of the qubits to switch the coupling effectively on and off, we demonstrate coherent transfer of quantum states between the qubits. The cavity is also used to perform multiplexed control and measurement of the qubit states. This approach can be expanded to more than two qubits, and is an attractive architecture for quantum information processing on a chip.},

abstract = {We develop a numerical procedure to efficiently model the nonequilibrium steady state of one-dimensional arrays of open quantum systems, based on a matrix-product operator ansatz for the density matrix. The procedure searches for the null eigenvalue of the Liouvillian superoperator by sweeping along the system while carrying out a partial diagonalization of the single-site stationary problem. It bears full analogy to the density-matrix renormalization group approach to the ground state of isolated systems, and its numerical complexity scales as a power law with the bond dimension. The method brings considerable advantage when compared to the integration of the time-dependent problem via Trotter decomposition, as it can address arbitrarily long-ranged couplings. Additionally, it ensures numerical stability in the case of weakly dissipative systems thanks to a slow tuning of the dissipation rates along the sweeps. We have tested the method on a driven-dissipative spin chain, under various assumptions for the Hamiltonian, drive, and dissipation parameters, and compared the results to those obtained both by Trotter dynamics and Monte-Carlo wave function. Accurate convergence to the nonequilibrium steady state was always reached without any sign of numerical instability. Our method improves significantly over a variational approach that was very recently introduced [J. Cui, J. Ignacio Cirac, M. C. Banuls, arXiv:1501.06786 (2015)], both in terms of numerical stability and computational complexity.},

abstract = {A photonic circuit is generally described as a structure in which light propagates by unitary exchange and transfers reversibly between channels. In contrast, the term ‘diffusive' is more akin to a chaotic propagation in scattering media, where light is driven out of coherence towards a thermal mixture. Based on the dynamics of open quantum systems, the combination of these two opposites can result in novel techniques for coherent light control. The crucial feature of these photonic structures is dissipative coupling between modes, via an interaction with a common reservoir. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that such systems can perform optical equalisation to smooth multimode light, or act as a distributor, guiding it into selected channels. Quantum thermodynamically, these systems can act as catalytic coherent reservoirs by performing perfect non-Landauer erasure. For lattice structures, localised stationary states can be supported in the continuum, similar to compacton-like states in conventional flat-band lattices.},

We report the realization of a " Lieb lattice " configuration with an optical lattice, which has a flat energy band as the first excited state. Our optical lattice potential has various degrees of freedom in its ma-nipulation, which enables coherent transfer of a Bose-Einstein condensate into the flat band. In addition to measuring lifetime of the flat band population for different tight-binding parameters, we investigate the inter-sublattice dynamics of the system by projecting the sublattice population onto the band population. This mea-surement clearly shows the formation of the localized state with the specific sublattice decoupled in the flat band, and even detects the presence of flat-band breaking perturbations, resulting in the delocalization. Our results will open up the possibilities of exploring the physics of flat bands with a highly controllable quantum system.},

@article{Takayoshi2013,
abstract = {To explore superfluidity in flat-band systems, we consider a Bose-Hubbard model on a cross-linked ladder with {\$}\backslashpi{\$} flux, which has a flat band with a gap between the other band for noninteracting particles, where we study the effect of the on-site repulsion nonperturbatively. For low densities, we find exact degenerate ground states, each of which is a Wigner solid with nonoverlapping Wannier states on the flat band. At higher densities, the many-body system, when projected onto the lower flat band, can be mapped to a spin-chain model. This mapping enables us to reveal the existence of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid comprising it pairs of bosons. Interestingly, the high- and low- density regions have an overlap, where the two phases coexist.},

abstract = {We study a one-dimensional model of interacting bosons on a lattice with two flat bands. Regular condensation is suppressed due to the absence of a well defined minimum in the single particle spectrum. We find that interactions stabilize a number of non-trivial phases like a pair (quasi-) condensate, a supersolid at incommensurable fillings and valence bond crystals at commensurability. We support our analytical calculations with numerical simulations using the density matrix renormalization group technique. Implications for cold-atoms and extensions to higher dimensions are discussed.},

Our results imply that a necessary condition for an exponential computational speedup (with respect to classical computations) is that the amount of entanglement increases with the size n of the computation, and provide an explicit lower bound on the required growth.},

@article{Wannier1937,
abstract = {In this article, a method is devised to study the energy spectrum for an excited electron configuration in an ideal crystal. The configuration studied consists of a single excited electron taken out of a full band of N electrons. The multiplicity of the state is N 2 . It is shown that because of the Coulomb attraction between the electron and its hole N 8 5 states are split off from the bottom of the excited Bloch band; for these states the electron cannot escape its hole completely. The analogy of these levels to the spectrum of an atom or molecule is worked out quantitatively. The bottom of the Bloch band appears as "ionization potential" and the Bloch band itself as the continuum above this threshold energy.},

@article{Yang2016,
abstract = {The concept of flat band plays an important role in strongly-correlated many-body physics. However, the demonstration of the flat band physics is highly nontrivial due to intrinsic limitations in conventional condensed matter materials. Here we propose a circuit quantum electrodynamics simulator of the 2D Lieb lattice exhibiting a flat middle band. By exploiting the simple parametric conversion method, we design a photonic Lieb lattice with $\backslash$textit{\{}in situ{\}} tunable hopping strengths in a 2D array of coupled superconducting transmissionline resonators. Moreover, the flexibility of our proposal enables the immediate incorporation of both the artificial gauge field and the strong photon-photon interaction in a time- and site-resolved manner. To unambiguously demonstrate the synthesized flat band, we further investigate the observation of the flat band localization of microwave photons through the pumping and the steady-state measurements of only few sites on the lattice. Requiring only current level of technique and being robust against imperfections in realistic circuits, our scheme can be readily tested in experiments and may pave a new way towards the future realization of exotic photonic quantum Hall fluids including anomalous quantum Hall effect and bosonic fractional quantum Hall states without magnetic fields.},

abstract = {We introduce a numerical algorithm to simulate the time evolution of a matrix product state under a long-ranged Hamiltonian. In the effectively one-dimensional representation of a system by matrix product states, long-ranged interactions are necessary to simulate not just many physical interactions but also higher-dimensional problems with short-ranged interactions. Since our method overcomes the restriction to short-ranged Hamiltonians of most existing methods, it proves particularly useful for studying the dynamics of both power-law interacting one-dimensional systems, such as Coulombic and dipolar systems, and quasi two-dimensional systems, such as strips or cylinders. First, we benchmark the method by verifying a long-standing theoretical prediction for the dynamical correlation functions of the Haldane-Shastry model. Second, we simulate the time evolution of an expanding cloud of particles in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a subject of several recent experiments.},
