abstract = {We present a new variational method, based on the matrix product operator (MPO) ansatz, for finding the steady state of dissipative quantum chains governed by master equations of the Lindblad form. Instead of requiring an accurate representation of the system evolution until the stationary state is attained, the algorithm directly targets the final state, thus allowing for a faster convergence when the steady state is a MPO with small bond dimension. Our numerical simulations for several dissipative spin models over a wide range of parameters illustrate the performance of the method and show that indeed the stationary state is often well described by a MPO of very moderate dimensions.},

abstract = {In some cases the state of a quantum system with a large number of subsystems can be approximated efficiently by the density-matrix renormalization group, which makes use of redundancies in the description of the state. Here we show that the achievable efficiency can be much better when performing density-matrix renormalization group calculations in the Heisenberg picture, as only the observable of interest but not the entire state is considered. In some nontrivial cases, this approach can even be exact for finite bond dimensions.},

@article{MFS15,
abstract = {We develop a numerical procedure to efficiently model the nonequilibrium steady state of one-dimensional arrays of open quantum systems, based on a matrix-product operator ansatz for the density matrix. The procedure searches for the null eigenvalue of the Liouvillian superoperator by sweeping along the system while carrying out a partial diagonalization of the single-site stationary problem. It bears full analogy to the density-matrix renormalization group approach to the ground state of isolated systems, and its numerical complexity scales as a power law with the bond dimension. The method brings considerable advantage when compared to the integration of the time-dependent problem via Trotter decomposition, as it can address arbitrarily long-ranged couplings. Additionally, it ensures numerical stability in the case of weakly dissipative systems thanks to a slow tuning of the dissipation rates along the sweeps. We have tested the method on a driven-dissipative spin chain, under various assumptions for the Hamiltonian, drive, and dissipation parameters, and compared the results to those obtained both by Trotter dynamics and Monte-Carlo wave function. Accurate convergence to the nonequilibrium steady state was always reached without any sign of numerical instability. Our method improves significantly over a variational approach that was very recently introduced [J. Cui, J. Ignacio Cirac, M. C. Banuls, arXiv:1501.06786 (2015)], both in terms of numerical stability and computational complexity.},

It should be a good place for newcomers to get familiarized with some of the key ideas in the field, specially regarding the numerics. After a very general introduction we motivate the concept of tensor network and provide several examples. We then move on to explain some basics about Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). Selected details on some of the associated numerical methods for 1. d and 2. d quantum lattice systems are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Schollwoeck11,
abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {This paper describes the PRIMME software package for solving large, sparse Hermitian standard eigenvalue problems. The difficulty and importance of these problems have increased over the years, necessitating the use of preconditioning and near optimally converging iterative methods. However, the complexity of tuning or even using such methods has kept them outside the reach of many users. Responding to this problem we have developed PRIMME, a comprehensive package that brings state-of-the-art methods from " bleeding edge " to production, with the best possible robustness, efficiency, and a flexible, yet highly usable interface that requires minimal or no tuning. We describe: (1) the PRIMME multimethod framework that implements a variety of algorithms, including the near optimal methods GD+k and JDQMR; (2) a host of algorithmic innovations and implementation techniques that endow the software with its robustness and efficiency; (3) a multi-layer interface that captures our experience and addresses the needs of both expert and end users.},
