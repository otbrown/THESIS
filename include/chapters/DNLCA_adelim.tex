Here we perform an adiabatic elimination of the doubly-excited state from the master equation for a driven nonlinear cavity array, resulting in an effective model for the system truncated to the subspace of at most one excitation per site. To do this, we follow the prescription given in Ref.~\cite{Garcia-Ripoll2009}, beginning by separating our initial three-level master equation \cref{eq:dnlca2-5} in to two components,
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{0} + \nu,
	\label{eq:adelim1}
\end{equation}
where the subspace dynamics of interest takes place in the stationary states of \(\mathcal{L}_{0}\), and \(\nu\) contains all other terms of the master equation.
