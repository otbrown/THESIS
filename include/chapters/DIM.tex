In this chapter we will discuss my contributions to the article `Dissipation-induced mobility and coherence in frustrated lattices' \cite{OBH17}. We will begin by discussing the motivation and theoretical background to the investigation, then we will discuss in some detail the design of the matrix product operator, which was complex due to the long range interactions present int his model, and was my primary contribution to the article. Finally we will present, and comment on results from this investigation.
