 \section{Introduction}
 In this chapter we consider variational searches using Matrix Product States. We will first discuss the theoretical underpinnings of such a technique -- what we vary, and what we search for. I will then describe details pertaining to my own implementations of these techniques. There is no suggestion that these implementation details represent best practise, or are in any sense \emph{the right way} to perform these calculations. They are merely how \emph{I} approached the problem. All these implementations were written in and for MATLAB, and can at time of writing be found in repositories hosted at Ref~\cite{otb:githome}.
