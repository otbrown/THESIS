 We will discuss the \lstinline$mpostat$ variational stationary state search code. The implementation is written for MATLAB \cite{MATLAB}, and at the time of writing is held in a git repository hosted at reference~\cite{otb:gitVSSS}. In this section we will use the conventions that \(N\) is the number of sites in our system, and \(d\) is the dimension of the local state space, so the total state space of our system would be \(d^{N}\), and the full density matrix has \(d^{2N}\) elements. \Cref{fig:vs2-2} shows the structure of the code diagramatically. To clearly distinguish between this and a ground state search, we refer to the matrix product state as a `density matrix product operator'. In order to write this code I referred to the ever useful reference~\cite{Schollwock2011}, and also to two more recent papers which dealt specifically with variational stationary state searches \cite{Cui2015,Mascarenhas2015}. Finally, we note that this code makes use of an external library, the PRIMME eigensolver \cite{Stathopoulos2010,Wu2017}.

% FORMATS
 \section{Standard format}
 Throughout this implementation I assume a standard format for both the density matrix product operator, and matrix product operator. Note that this format is specific to this implementation, and does not conform to any standard which may or may not exist within the wider community.
 \subsection{Density matrix product operator}
 The density matrix product operator is, at the highest level, an \(N \times 1\) cell array. Each cell, \(n\), contains the site tensor \(A^{[n]}_{r,c,i,j}\). The cell array is used rather than a standard array structure, as it allows each site tensor to have different dimensions. Each site tensor is a 4-dimensional complex double array, with the first two indices corresponding to the virtual dimensions (`\emph{r}ow' and `\emph{c}olumn'), and the second two corresponding to the physical indices of the density matrix, \(\rho = |i \rangle \langle j|\). The size of the virtual dimensions will always be \(1 \times d^{2}\) on the first site, and \(d^{2} \times 1\) on the last site, and will grow by a factor of \(d^{2}\) up to the middle site, after which they will shrink by a factor of \(d^{2}\). The virtual dimensions will not be allowed to exceed the limit imposed by \(\chi_{\mathrm{max}}\). If the limit is reached the size of each virtual dimension will be \(\chi_{\mathrm{max}}\) until it naturally drops back below this limit, nearer the end of the system.

  	\(A^{[n]}_{r,c,i,j}\) & \lstinline$dmpo\{n\}(r,c,i,j)$
 \end{tabu}

\subsection{Matrix product operator}
The matrix product operator is also an \(N \times 1\) cell array. Each cell contains the MPO tensor \(O^{[n]}_{i,j,k,l,p,q}\). Each tensor is a 6-dimensional complex double array, with the first four indices corresponding to the physical dimensions of the Liouvillian (an input and output density matrix), and the last two indices corresponding to the MPO virtual dimensions. The size of the first virtual dimension on the first site, and the second virtual dimension on the last site is always 1, as the MPO also follows the convention of beginning with a row vector, and ending with a column vector. Unlike the DMPO, the MPO has the same virtual dimensions on every site between the first and last.

% TOP FUNCTIONS
 \section{DDMPO}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is a constructor function for a density matrix product operator. It creates a DMPO which represents a normalised density matrix with the same real value in every element. For example, for a two qubit system \lstinline$DDMPO$ would create a density matrix product operator corresponding to the density matrix,
 \begin{equation}
 \rho = \begin{pmatrix}
 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 \\
 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 \\
 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 \\
 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 \end{pmatrix}.
 \label{eq:vs3-4}
 \end{equation}
 This function depends on \lstinline$DMPOScalarDiv$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [dmpo] = DDMPO(HILBY, LENGTH, COMPRESS) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,l]X[4,l]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix productor operator in the standard format. Created by making the first element in every matrix \(A^{[n]}_{i,j}\) one, with the rest all zeroes. The DMPO is then trace normalised.  \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$HILBY$ & \emph{Double}. The size of the local state space, \(d\). Should be a positive integer, greater than 1. \\
 \lstinline$LENGTH$ & \emph{Double}. The number of sites in the system, \(N\). Should be a positive integer, greater than 1. \\
 \lstinline$COMPRESS$ & \emph{Double}. The maximum size, \(\chi_{\mathrm{max}}\) of the virtual dimensions of the density matrix product state site tensors, \(A^{[n]}\). If \lstinline$COMPRESS == 0$ on input, it will be set to \lstinline$Inf$, leaving the DMPO uncompressed. Should be a positive integer either equal to zero, or greater than or equal to \(d^{2}\). If \(0 <\) \lstinline$COMPRESS$ \(< d^{2}\) an error will be thrown. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$DDMPOTest$. Checks the type, size, and shape of the density matrix product operator. It checks that compression is properly applied, and that the error \lstinline$DDMPO:BadCOMPRESS$ is thrown if a bad value of \lstinline$COMPRESS$ is supplied. It checks that the trace is one, and that a sample of the density matrix elements are all equal to one another.

 \section{PhasedSearch}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is a top-level function for the variational stationary state search. It takes information about the system which is to be solved, and some calculation parameters. The function has two return values -- a DMPO which approximates the stationary state of the system, and a vector containing the eigenvalue recorded at the end of each \emph{phase} of the calculation. This terminology is borrowed from sports (a phase of play). Here it describes the process of finding the stationary state of the system using a DMPO of some particular dimension, at the end of the calculation the eigenvalue is evaluated against the desired accuracy threshold, and if it is not close enough to zero the current state is copied to a DMPO representation with a larger matrix dimension (as long as this can be done without breaching a limit set by the user). The available calculation variants are \lstinline$direct$ which solves the Liouvillian, \(\hat{\mathcal{L}}\), \lstinline$hermitian$ which solves the Hermitian product of the Liouvillian, \(\hat{\mathcal{L}}^{\dagger}\hat{\mathcal{L}}\), and \lstinline$primme$ which solves the Hermitian problem using the PRIMME eigensolver \cite{Stathopoulos2010,Wu2017}. The user is expected to provide the appropriate MPO for the variant they specify, but an error will be thrown if you try to run a Hermitian calculation with the MPO for \(\hat{\mathcal{L}}\). The reverse is not checked on the basis that finding the MPO of the Hermitian product of the Liouvillian involves an additional computational step which the end user is unlikely to invoke accidentally. This function is dependent on \lstinline$DDMPO$, \lstinline$Stationary$, and \lstinline$DMPOResize$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [dmpoStat, phaseTrack] = PhasedSearch(HILBY, LENGTH, mpo, ULTIMATE_THRESHOLD, MAX_COMPRESS, VARIANT) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,1]X[4,1]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpoStat$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. Contains a density matrix product operator representing the approximate stationary state of the system. DMPO is in the standard format used in this implementation. \\
 \lstinline$phaseTrack$ & \emph{1 dimensional complex double array}. Contains the eigenvalue recorded at the end of each phase of the calculation. If the last entry is less than the threshold set by the user then the calculation is regarded as having been successful. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$HILBY$ & \emph{Double}. The size of the local state space, \(d\). Should be a positive integer, greater than one. \\
 \lstinline$LENGTH$ & \emph{Double}. The number of sites in the system, \(N\). Should be a positive integer greater than one. \\
 \lstinline$mpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. Liouvillian for the system in matrix product operator form. It is important that the supplied Liouvillian matches the requested calculation variant. If the user requests the Hermitian calculation variant is requested, then the MPO should represent the hermitian product Liouvillian \(\mathcal{L}^{\dagger}\mathcal{L}\), or the \lstinline$EigenSolver$ function will throw an error. \\
 \lstinline$ULTIMATE_THRESHOLD$ & \emph{Double}. The desired final accuracy, as determined by the residual \(|\mathcal{L}\rho|\), or \(|\mathcal{L}^{\dagger}\mathcal{L}\rho|\) in the Hermitian case. The calculation will end and return the results once it crosses this threshold (if it crosses this threshold). \\
 \lstinline$MAX_COMPRESS$ & \emph{Double}. The maximum allowed DMPO matrix dimension, \(\chi\). Should be a positive integer greater than or equal to \(d^{2}\). \\
 \lstinline$VARIANT$ & \emph{String}. Specifies the form and method of the calculation. There are three options: `\lstinline$direct$', `\lstinline$hermitian$', and `\lstinline$primme$'. If `\lstinline$direct$' is supplied, the non-Hermitian Liouvillian \(\mathcal{L}\) is solved using MATLAB's sparse eigensolver, \lstinline$eigs$. If `\lstinline$hermitian$' or `\lstinline$primme$' is supplied, the Hermitian product of the Liouvillian \(\mathcal{L}^{\dagger}\mathcal{L}\) is solved using the \lstinline$eigs$ and PRIMME eigensolvers respectively. Additionally, if `\lstinline$hermitian$' is supplied, but \lstinline$eigs$ fails to find a solution on some site, a second attempt will be made using the PRIMME eigensolver. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$PhasedSearchTest$. Checks that an error is thrown if the Hermiticity error in the effective Liouvillian is large -- this is a symptom of having supplied an MPO for the Liouvillian operator \(\mathcal{L}\), but requested the Hermitian problem be solved. Checks that the two return values are the right size, shape and class. Checks that for all three calculation variants, the trace of the solution density matrix is one, and that the eigenvalue is as close to zero as it ought to be (i.e. that it is less than \lstinline$ULTIMATE_THRESHOLD$). A test problem is run which has the trivial stationary state of no occupation in any site (the `all-zero' state), it is checked that the solution density matrix has a 1 in this state, and other elements are sampled and checked for erroneous non-zero values.

 \section{ProdDMPO}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is a constructor function for a density matrix product operator. It creates a DMPO which represents a specified simple product state. That is it forms the density matrix,
 \begin{equation}
 \rho = | i_{1} i_{2} \ldots i_{N} \rangle \langle i_{1} i_{2} \ldots i_{N} |,
 \label{eq:vs3-3}
 \end{equation}
 for some product state \(|i_{1} i_{2} \ldots i_{N} \rangle\). This function depends on \lstinline$FWBase$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [prodDMPO] = ProdDMPO(HILBY, LENGTH, COMPRESS, STATE) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,l]X[4,l]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$prodDMPO$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix product operator in the standard format which corresponds to a simple product state, specified by \lstinline$STATE$. Created by initialising all tensors \(A^{[n]}\) as zero arrays, and then replacing the appropriate \(A^{[n]}_{i,j}\) matrices with identities. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$HILBY$ & \emph{Double}. The size of the local state space, \(d\). Should be a positive integer, greater than 1. \\
 \lstinline$LENGTH$ & \emph{Double}. The number of sites in the system, \(N\). Should be a positive integer, greater than 1. \\
 \lstinline$COMPRESS$ & \emph{Double}. The maximum size, \(\chi_{\mathrm{max}}\) of the virtual dimensions of the density matrix product state site tensors, \(A^{[n]}\). If \lstinline$COMPRESS == 0$, it will be set to \lstinline$Inf$, leaving the DMPO uncompressed. Should be a positive integer either equal to zero, or greater than or equal to \(d^{2}\). If \(0 <\) \lstinline$COMPRESS$ \(< d^{2}\) an error will be thrown. \\
 \lstinline$STATE$ & \emph{Double}. The decimal value given by treating the desired state as a big-endian, \(N\)-bit, base \(d\) string. For example for any size system, \lstinline$STATE = 0$ gives the state \(| 0_{1} 0_{2} \ldots 0_{N} \rangle \). For a 3 site, 3-level system, \lstinline$STATE = 12$ would correspond to the state \(|1_{1} 1_{2} 0_{3} \rangle\).  \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$ProdDMPOTest$. Checks the type, size, and shape of the density matrix product operator. It checks that compression is properly applied, and that the error \lstinline$ProdDMPO:BadCOMPRESS$ is thrown if a bad value of \lstinline$COMPRESS$ is supplied. It checks that the trace is one, and that the specific density matrix element corresponding to the specified state is one.

 \section{Stationary}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is a top-level function for the variational stationary state search. It takes information about the system to be solved, and returns an approximation to the stationary state. The difference between this and the \lstinline$PhasedSearch$ top-level function is that \lstinline$Stationary$ will try to solve the problem using the supplied matrix dimension and will either succeed, or fail -- it will \emph{not} attempt any resizing of the DMPO. In fact during each phase \lstinline$PhasedSearch$ calls \lstinline$Stationary$ with either a lower accuracy threshold, or a larger matrix dimension. In the event that \lstinline$Stationary$ fails to reach the specified threshold it will print a message to stdout, and return the current state. This function is dependent on \lstinline$Can$, \lstinline$GrowBlock$, \lstinline$EffL$, \lstinline$EigenSolver$, \lstinline$ConvTest$, and \lstinline$TrNorm$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [dmpoStat, eigTrack] = Stationary(dmpoInit, mpo, THRESHOLD, variant) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,1]X[4,1]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpoStat$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix product operator representing the approximate stationary state of the system. DMPO is in the standard format used in this implementation. \\
 \lstinline$eigTrack$ & \emph{1 dimensional complex double array}. The eigenvalues from the last \(2(N-1)\) site updates. These eigenvalues are tested for convergence after each update, and if the last element is lower than the threshold set by the user, then the calculation is regarded as having been successful. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpoInit$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. Contains some initial density matrix product operator. The closer this is to the stationary state, the faster the calculation will converge. The matrix dimensions of this input DMPO determine the matrix dimensions of the output DMPO, \lstinline$dmpoStat$.  \\
 \lstinline$mpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. Liouvillian for the system in matrix product operator form. It is important that the supplied Liouvillian matches the requested calculation variant. If the user requests the Hermitian calculation variant is requested, then the MPO should represent the hermitian product Liouvillian \(\mathcal{L}^{\dagger}\mathcal{L}\), or the \lstinline$EigenSolver$ function will throw an error.\\
 \lstinline$THRESHOLD$ & \emph{Double}. The desired final accuracy, as determined by the residual \(|\mathcal{L}\rho|\), or \(|\mathcal{L}^{\dagger}\mathcal{L}\rho|\) in the Hermitian case. The calculation will end and the return the results once it crosses this threshold (if it crosses this threshold). \\
 \lstinline$variant$ & \emph{String}. Specifies the form and method of the calculation. There are three options: `\lstinline$direct$', `\lstinline$hermitian$', and `\lstinline$primme$'. If `\lstinline$direct$' is supplied, the non-Hermitian Liouvillian \(\mathcal{L}\) is solved using MATLAB's sparse eigensolver, \lstinline$eigs$. If `\lstinline$hermitian$' or `\lstinline$primme$' is supplied, the Hermitian product of the Liouvillian \(\mathcal{L}^{\dagger}\mathcal{L}\) is solved using the \lstinline$eigs$ and PRIMME eigensolvers respectively. Additionally, if `\lstinline$hermitian$' is supplied, but \lstinline$eigs$ fails to find a solution on some site, a second attempt will be made using the PRIMME eigensolver. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$StationaryTest$. Checks that the two return values are the right size, shape, and class. Checks that errors are thrown in the event that a bad \lstinline$variant$ is supplied, or if a non-Hermitian MPO is supplied with a Hermitian variant. Checks that for all three calculation variants the returned stationary state has a trace of one, and is in the correct state, and that the final eigenvalue is less than \lstinline$THRESHOLD$.

 \section{ZDMPO}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is a constructor function for a density matrix product operator. This function creates a DMPO which represents a density matrix with the same real value as every element, precisely the same as \lstinline$DDMPO$. The difference is in the construction -- \lstinline$ZDMPO$ fills every element in every tensor \(A^{[n]}\) with a complex number. This is useful for testing and debugging, as the very sparse and completely real tensors created by \lstinline$DDMPO$ can sometimes help conceal bugs. This function depends on \lstinline$TrNorm$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [dmpo] = ZDMPO(HILBY, LENGTH, COMPRESS) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,l]X[4,l]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix product operator in the standard format. Created by filling every site tensor with the complex number \(Z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1 + 1i)\). The density matrix product operator is then trace normalised. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$HILBY$ & \emph{Double}. The size of the local state space, \(d\). Should be a positive integer, greater than one.  \\
 \lstinline$LENGTH$ & \emph{Double}. The number of sites in the system, \(N\). Should be a positive integer greater than one. \\
 \lstinline$COMPRESS$ & \emph{Double}. The maximum size, \(\chi_{\mathrm{max}}\) of the virtual dimensions of the density matrix product state site tensors, \(A^{[n]}\). As in the ground state code, if \lstinline$COMPRESS == 0$, it will be set to \lstinline$Inf$, leaving the density matrix product operator uncompressed. Should be a positive integer either equal to zero, or greater than or equal to \(d^{2}\). If \(0 <\) \lstinline$COMPRESS$ \(< d^{2}\) an error will be thrown. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$ZDMPOTest$. Checks that the density matrix product operator is the right type, size, and shape, including that compression is properly applied. Additionally, the test checks that the error \lstinline$ZDMPO:BadCOMPRESS$ is thrown in the event of a bad value of \lstinline$COMPRESS$ being supplied, and that the state is trace normalised.

% CORE FUNCTIONS
 \section{Can}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is an interface function for the two DMPO normalisation functions, \lstinline$LCan$ and \lstinline$RCan$. Normalisation of a matrix product state is performed by taking the singular value decomposition of a (reshaped) site tensor, \(A^{[n]} = USV^{\dagger}\). The new renormalised site tensor \(\tilde{A}^{[n]}\) is formed from the product \(US\), while \(V^{\dagger}\) is multiplied into the following site -- this is referred to as `left-canonical' normalisation. Alternatively, the new site tensor is formed from \(V^{\dagger}\) and \(US\) is multiplied into the following site -- this is referred to as `right-canonical' normalisation. The two procedures are sufficiently different to warrant entirely separate implementations, and the correct one must be called depending on which direction the code is presently `sweeping' through the system. This function's purpose is to simplify the call syntax, and control logic in the top-level functions. This function is dependent on \lstinline$LCan$, and \lstinline$RCan$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [cdmpo] = Can(dmpo, route, direction) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,1]X[4,1]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$cdmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix product operator which represents the same state as the input DMPO, \lstinline$dmpo$, but with the site(s) specified by \lstinline$route$ left or right canonically normalised. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix product operator in the standard format. \\
 \lstinline$route$ & \emph{1 dimensional double array}. Specifies the site or site which should be normalised. An error will be thrown if the last site in the system (site \(N\) for left-canonical, site \(1\) for right-canonical) is included in the route. An error will also be thrown if the supplied route does not match the supplied direction -- meaning the indices must be increasing for left-canonical normalisation, and decreasing for right-canonical normalisation. \\
 \lstinline$direction$ & \emph{Character}. This should be `L' for left-canonical normalisation, or `R' for right-canonical normalisation. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$CanTest$. Checks that the trace of the DMPO is preserved, and that the appropriate error messages are thrown.

 \section{DMPOHerm}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This mid-level function returns the Hermitian part of a supplied density matrix product operator. It does this by performing the following operation,
 \begin{equation}
 \tilde{\rho} = \frac{\rho + \rho^{\dagger}}{2}.
 \label{eq:vs3-2}
 \end{equation}
 It should be noted that the operation to add two matrix product operators involves doubling the size of the virtual dimensions on each site. Consequently, this function will do the same regardless of what compression limits may have been previously set. The state should therefore be compressed after the use of this function. This function depends on \lstinline$DMPOConj$, \lstinline$DMPOSum$, and \lstinline$DMPOScalarDiv$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [hermDMPO] = DMPOHerm(dmpo) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,l]X[4,l]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$hermDMPO$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. The hermitian part of the supplied density matrix product operator, in the standard format. Will have double the virtual dimensions on each site. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix product operator, in the standard format. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$DMPOHermTest$. Checks the \lstinline$hermDMPO$ has the right type, size, and shape. Additionally checks that the trace has been preserved from the input, that the trace is real, and that \lstinline$hermDMPO$ is Hermitian. It does the test for Hermiticity by sampling elements from the density matrix, and checking the transpose element.

 \section{DMPOResize}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is an interface function for the two DMPO resizing functions, \lstinline$DMPOCompress$, and \lstinline$DMPOEnlarge$. It greatly simplifies call syntax in the top-level functions. This function depends on \lstinline$DMPOCompress$, \lstinline$DMPOEnlarge$, and \lstinline$TrNorm$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [rsDMPO] = DMPOResize(dmpo, COMPRESS) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,1]X[4,1]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$rsDMPO$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. The appropriately resized density matrix operator, in the standard format. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix product operator, in the standard format. \\
 \lstinline$COMPRESS$ & \emph{Double}. Should be a positive integer, greater than or equal to \(d^{2}\). The new maximum matrix dimension for the DMPO, \(\chi\). The first thing the function does is check the current maximum dimension of the supplied DMPO, by measuring the middle site tensor. If \lstinline$COMPRESS$ is smaller, but larger than \(d^{2}\) then the function hands over to \lstinline$DMPOCompress$. If \lstinline$COMPRESS$ is larger, and then the current dimension is less than that required for an exact representation, the function hands over to \lstinline$DMPOEnlarge$. Finally, if the current dimension is the same as \lstinline$COMPRESS$, the function quietly returns \lstinline$dmpo$. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$DMPOResizeTest$. Checks that the returned DMPO is the right size (across all variants of the `right' size), and that a too small value of \lstinline$COMPRESS$ is rejected, and an error thrown.

 \section{EffL}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is an interface function for the low-level function which forms the effective Liouvillian matrix using the contraction procedure given in \cref{eq:vs1-9} and \cref{fig:vs1-4}. It does not perform the contraction itself, but provides a simplified call syntax for top-level functions, and allows for easier replacement of the low-level function. This function is dependent on \lstinline$EffLSparse$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [effectiveLiouv] = EffL(TARGET, dmpo, mpo, left, right) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,1]X[4,1]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$effectiveLiouv$ & \emph{2 dimensional sparse complex double array}. This very large, sparse, matrix is an effective Liouvillian for that particular site in the system. It is eigensolved, and the eigenvector reshaped to replace the site tensor. The exact dimensions are dependent on the particular matrix dimensions, but it will be largest in the middle of the system where the matrix dimensions approach the maximum allowed, \(\chi\). There the dimensions will be \(\chi^{2}d^{2} \times \chi^{2}d^{2}\). For that reason it is this point in the calculation that places the greatest burden on the available memory. This function is dependent on \lstinline$EffLSparse$. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$TARGET$ & \emph{Double}. The site on which the effective Liouvillian is to be formed, should be a positive integer. \\
 \lstinline$dmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix product operator in the standard format. \\
 \lstinline$mpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. The Liouvillian for the system in matrix product operator form. \\
 \lstinline$left$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. Contractions from site 1 up to each site in the system. \\
 \lstinline$right$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. Contractions from site \(N\) up to each site in the system. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$EffLTest$. Checks that \lstinline$effectiveLiouv$ is a double array, is sparse, and is the right size.

 \section{EigenSolver}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is an interface function for the eigensolving routines. Depending on the calculation variant chosen by the user MATLAB's built-in \lstinline$eigs$ function, or \lstinline$primme_eigs$ from the PRIMME library may be used. This function simplifies the call syntax and control logic in the top-level function, and makes it easier to experiment with different eigensolvers.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [eigVector, eigValue] = EigenSolver(effL, HERMITIAN, PRIMME, initVec, HERMITICITY_THRESHOLD) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[2,1]X[3,1]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$eigVector$ & \emph{1 dimensional complex double array}. The eigenvector of the effective Liouvillian with the eigenvalue closest to zero. This will be reshaped to replace the site tensor, \(A^{[n]}\). \\
 \lstinline$eigValue$ & \emph{Complex double}. The eigenvalue corresponding to \lstinline$eigVector$. This is the closest to zero of all the eigenvalues of the supplied effective Liouvillian. How close it actually is to zero is used as a measure of success for the whole calculation. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$effL$ & \emph{2 dimensional complex double array}. The effective Liouvillian \(\hat{L}^{[n]}_{\mathrm{eff}}\) for some site, may be formed from the Liouvillian \(\mathcal{L}\), or the hermitian product of the Liouvillian, \(\mathcal{L}^{\dagger}\mathcal{L}\). \\
 \lstinline$HERMITIAN$ & \emph{Bool}. Should be true if the Hermitian product of the Liouvillian is being used. \\
 \lstinline$PRIMME$ & \emph{Bool}. Should be true if use of PRIMME is desired. Note that this will only have an impact if \lstinline$HERMITIAN = true$, as PRIMME's eigensolver only operates on Hermitian matrices. If \lstinline$HERMITIAN$ is false, then \lstinline$PRIMME$ should be too, but its value will be ignored. \\
 \lstinline$initVec$ & \emph{1 dimensional complex double array}. An initial guess for the eigenvector -- supplying this improves the stability and speed of the eigensolvers. In general this will be the current site tensor reshaped into a vector. \\
 \lstinline$HERMITICITY_THRESHOLD$ & \emph{Double, optional}. This is an optional argument. If the Hermitian product Liouvillian is being used then the effective Liouvillian should also be Hermitian. That said, it is almost certainly not due to numerical error. This problem is solved by taking the average of the effective Liouvillian and it's Hermitian conjugate, and supplying that to the eigensolving routines. If \lstinline$HERMITICITY_THRESHOLD$ is supplied, the difference \(|\hat{L} - \hat{L}^{\dagger}|\) is calculated and tested against it. If this test is failed it indicates that the MPO supplied to the top-level function is for \(\mathcal{L}\), not \(\mathcal{L}^{\dagger}\mathcal{L}\). If \lstinline$HERMITIAN = false$, this argument will be ignored.  \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$EigenSolverTest$. Checks that an error is thrown if \\
  \lstinline$HERMITICITY_THRESHOLD$ is supplied and an MPO for \(\mathcal{L}\) is used, and that the eigenvalue and eigenvectors found by each variant of the problem are self-consistent. That is if the non-Hermitian eigensolver is used, it consistently finds the same eigenvector and eigenvalue for some fixed input -- each of the three return a slightly different eigenvalue and vector, which is to be expected.

 \section{GrowBlock}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This is an interface function for the two tensor network contraction functions, \lstinline$GrowLeft$, and \lstinline$GrowRight$. After each site update in a sweep the contraction of the network up to and including that site must be updated. Obviously this is dependent on the direction through the system the sweep is moving, so this function exists to simplify the call syntax, and control logic of the top-level functions. This function is dependent on \lstinline$GrowLeft$, and \lstinline$GrowRight$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [updateBlock] = GrowBlock(dmpo, mpo, left, right, site, direction) \end{lstlisting}

 \lstinline$right$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. Each cell \(n\) contains the contraction of the tensor network from site \(N\) to site \(n+1\) (the contraction from the `right'). The last cell simply contains a 1. \\
 \lstinline$site$ & \emph{Double}. The site which is to be included in a contraction either from the left or right end of the system.  \\
 \lstinline$direction$ & \emph{Character}. Either `L' or `R'. Specifies whether the site should be included in a contraction from the left (from site 1), or the right (site \(N\)). \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$GrowBlockTest$. Checks that the return arrays are the correct class and are not empty, and that an error is thrown if a bad \lstinline$direction$ is supplied.

 \section{TrNorm}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This mid-level function normalises a density matrix product operator by dividing it by its trace. This normalisation is physically relevant, but makes no difference to the calculation. This function depends on \lstinline$DMPOTrace$, and \lstinline$DMPOScalarDiv$.
 \begin{lstlisting}

 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,l]X[4,l]}

 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$TrNormTest$. Checks that \lstinline$normDMPO$ has the same class, size, and shape as \lstinline$dmpo$, and checks that the trace is one.

% UTIL FUNCTIONS
 \section{ConvTest}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This low-level function is used to determine whether or not the calculation has converged. It does this by finding the mean of the difference between sequential elements of the supplied vector, and testing it against some threshold. That is the following is calculated,
 \begin{equation}
 	\bar{x} = \frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{j}^{M-1} | x_{j+1} - x_{j} |,
 \end{equation}
 and tested against some threshold value \(x_{\mathrm{th}}\), where \(M\) is the size of the data set supplied, and \(x\) is some vector. In the context of the stationary state search, the input vector contains the eigenvalues from the last \(M\) site updates, and convergence is tested against the user-defined convergence threshold.
 \begin{lstlisting}

 \lstinline$THRESHOLD$ & \emph{Double}. The value against which \lstinline$convergence$ is to be tested. If \lstinline$convergence$ \(<\) \lstinline$THRESHOLD$, then \lstinline$convFlag$ is set to true. \\

 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$ConvTestTest$. Checks that the function does not return true when the input vector contains \lstinline$NaN$ values, or is nearly (but not quite) converged, and that it does correctly return a true value.

 \section{DMPOCompress}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This low-level function compresses the virtual dimensions of a density matrix product oeprator, so that they do not exceed the limit \(\chi_{\mathrm{max}}\). A sparse singular value decomposoition is performed at each site which needs to be compressed, and only \(\chi_{\mathrm{max}}\) singular values retained. Only sites whose virtual dimension previously exceeded \(\chi_{\mathrm{max}}\) are affected. This function is interfaced by \lstinline$DMPOResize$.
 \begin{lstlisting}

 \end{longtabu}

 \section{DMPOConj}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This low-level function calculates the Hermitian conjugate density matrix product operator, by conjugating the matrices \(A^{[n]}_{i,j}\), and swapping their physical indices.
 \begin{lstlisting}

 \section{DMPOExp}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This low-level function calculates the expectation value of some set of locally acting operator \(\hat{O}\), by calculating \(\mathrm{Tr}[\hat{O}\rho]\). The format of the operator here is that it should be a three dimensional complex double array, with the first two indices referencing the local physical state, and the third indexing the site.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [expect] = DMPOExp(dmpo, op) \end{lstlisting}

Some set of locally acting operators, in the format \(\langle\)\lstinline$braState$\(| \hat{O}^{[n]} |\)\lstinline$ketState$\(\rangle =\) \lstinline$op(braState, ketState, site)$. For example, if one wanted to calculate the expectation of the spin-flip operator acting on the first site in a spin chain, then \lstinline$op(:, :, 1)$, would be the spin-flip operator
\(\left(
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0
 \end{smallmatrix}
\right),\) while every other matrix in the array, \lstinline$op(:, :, 2:end)$, would be the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix.\\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$DMPOExpTest$. Checks the type of \lstinline$expect$, the trace of a set of density matrix product operators, and the expectation value of \(\hat{n}\) on some product states.

 \section{DMPOScalarDiv}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This low-level function divides a density matrix product operator by a scalar value. Currently it does so simply by dividing the first site tensor \(A^{[1]}\) by the scalar.
 \begin{lstlisting}

 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. Some density matrix product operator, in the standard format. \\
 \lstinline$scalar$ & \emph{Complex double}. Some complex (or real) number. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$DMPOScalarDivTest$. Checks that type, size, and shape of the returned density matrix product operator. Checks that \(\mathrm{Tr}[\tilde{\rho}] = \mathrm{Tr}[\rho] / a\), and by sampling elements from the density matrix, that the division has been carried out correctly.

 \section{DMPOSum}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This low-level function adds two density matrix product operators, which represent the same system, together. Given two density matrix product operators,
 \begin{align}
 |\bar{\rho}_{A} \rangle &= \sum_{i_{1}\ldots i_{N}} \sum_{j_{1} \ldots j_{N}} A^{[1]}_{i,j} A^{[2]}_{i,j} \ldots A^{[N]}_{i,j} |j_{1} j_{2} \ldots j_{N} \rangle \otimes |i_{1} i_{2} \ldots i_{N} \rangle, \label{eq:vs3-5} \\
 |\bar{\rho}_{B} \rangle &= \sum_{l_{1} \ldots l_{N}} \sum_{m_{1} \ldots m_{N}} B^{[1]}_{l,m} B^{[2]}_{l,m} \ldots B^{[N]}_{l,m} |m_{1} m_{2} \ldots m_{N} \rangle \otimes |l_{1} l_{2} \ldots l_{N} \rangle, \label{eq:vs3-6}
 \end{align}
 we perform the summation, \(|\bar{\rho}_{C} \rangle = |\bar{\rho}_{A} \rangle + |\bar{\rho}_{B} \rangle\) with the following procedure. We form \(C^{[1]}\) by concatenating \(A^{[1]}\) and \(B^{[1]}\) along the second virtual dimension, and we form \(C^{[N]}\) by concatenating \(A^{[N]}\) and \(B^{[N]}\) along the first virtual dimension. For all the other sites, we create the block diagonal matrices,
 \begin{equation}
 C^{[n]} = \begin{pmatrix}
 A^{[n]} & 0 \\
 0 & B^{[n]} \end{pmatrix},
 \label{eq:vs3-7}
 \end{equation}
 which we can see leads to \(|\bar{\rho}_{C} \rangle \) having virtual dimensions which are the sum of those in \(|\bar{\rho}_{A}\rangle\) and \(|\bar{\rho}_{B}\rangle\). It is also not trace normalised. For this reason it is recommended that any use of \lstinline$DMPOSum$ is followed by \lstinline$DMPOCompress$ and \lstinline$TrNorm$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [sumDMPO] = DMPOSum(rhoA, rhoB) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,l]X[4,l]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline

 \lstinline$rhoB$ & A density matrix product operator, in the standard format. If its size and physical dimensions do not match those of \lstinline$rhoA$, an error will be thrown. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$DMPOSumTest$. Checks the type, size, and shape of \lstinline$sumDMPO$. Checks that an error is thrown if the two input systems do not match. Checks that the trace of \lstinline$sumDMPO$ is the sum of the trace of \lstinline$rhoA$ and \lstinline$rhoB$, and samples the density matrix to check the summation has been performed correctly.

 \section{DMPOTrace}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This low-level function calculates the trace of a density matrix product operator. It uses the same contraction as \lstinline$DMPOExp$, only it ignores non-diagonal terms.

 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,l]X[4,l]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline

 \section{MPOHermProd}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This low-level function returns an MPO representing the Hermitian product (\(\mathcal{L}^{\dagger}\mathcal{L}\)) of a Liouvillian supplied in MPO form. In this way the user can avoid having to explicitly formulate the MPO representation of the Hermitian product of the Liouvillian. For efficiency reasons this is never done automatically by a top-level function, so the user must always take care to supply the correct MPO.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 	function [hmpo] = MPOHermProd(mpo) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,1]X[4,1]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$hmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. The Hermitian product of the input Liouvillian, in MPO form. Note that the virtual dimensions of this MPO are the square of those from the input. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$mpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. Some Liouvillian, in matrix product operator form. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$MPOHermProdTest$. Checks that the returned MPO is the right size and shape. Rebuilds the Liouvillian from the returned MPO, and checks that it is Hermitian, and that it is the Hermitian product of the input Liouvillian.

 \section{RCan}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This low-level function returns a right-canonically normalised site tensor, and its now non-canonical following neighbour. This function is interfaced by \lstinline$Can$.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [canSite, nextSiteUS] = RCan(siteTensor, nextSiteTensor, HILBY, ROW_SIZE, COL_SIZE, NEXT_ROW) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,l]X[4,l]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$canSite$ & \emph{4 dimensional complex double array}. The left-canonically normalised density matrix product operator tensor for the site \(n\), in the standard format. \\
 \lstinline$nextSiteUS$ & \emph{4 dimensional complex double array}. The non-canonical density matrix product operator tensor for the site \(n-1\), in the standard format. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$siteTensor$ & \emph{4 dimensional complex double array}. The density matrix product operator tensor for the site \(n\), in the standard format. \\
 \lstinline$nextSiteTensor$ & \emph{4 dimensional complex double array}. The density matrix product operator tensor for the site \(n-1\), in the standard format. \\
 \lstinline$HILBY$ & \emph{Double}. The size of the local state space, \(d\). Should be a positive integer, greater than 1. \\
 \lstinline$ROW_SIZE$ & \emph{Double}. The size of the the first virtual dimension of \lstinline$siteTensor$. Should be a positive integer.  \\
 \lstinline$COL_SIZE$ & \emph{Double}. The size of the the second virtual dimension of \lstinline$siteTensor$. Should be a positive integer. \\
 \lstinline$NEXT_ROW$ & \emph{Double}. The size of the the first virtual dimension of \lstinline$nextSiteTensor$. Should be a positive integer. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$RCanTest$. Checks the type, size, and shape of a density matrix product operator, operated on by \lstinline$RCan$. Checks that the right-canonical normalisation condition holds. Checks that the function does not alter the trace, or a sample of the elements of the density matrix.

 \section{SVDNorm}
 \paragraph{Docstring} This function uses the SVD decomposition to vector normalise a density matrix product operator. Essentially the same as \lstinline$LCan$, except it includes the last site in the system, and simply throws away the last \(V^{\dagger}\) matrix. Has no impact on the physicality of the density matrix product operator, so should only be used at initialisation. Thereafter the process of left and right normalising individual site tensors ensures that the density matrix product operator remains vector normalised.
 \begin{lstlisting}
 function [normDMPO] = SVDNorm(dmpo) \end{lstlisting}
 \begin{longtabu}{X[1,l]X[4,l]}
 \hline
 Return & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$normDMPO$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A vector normalised density matrix product operator in the standard format. \\ \hline
 Input & \\ \hline
 \lstinline$dmpo$ & \emph{\(N \times 1\) cell array}. A density matrix product operator, in the standard format. \\
 \hline
 \end{longtabu}
 \paragraph{Testing} \lstinline$SVDNormTest$. Checks the type, size, and shape of the returned density matrix product operator. Using a small system rebuilds the full vectorised density matrix, and confirms it has a vector norm of one.
