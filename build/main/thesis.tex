\begin{acknowledgements}
First of all, I must thank my supervisor Michael Hartmann. He has been incredibly supportive, and allowed me to develop my interests in scientific software development. At times his patience has seemingly tended to infinity, particularly while reviewing this thesis! I would also like to thank my undergraduate supervisor, Sabrina Maniscalco, without whom I would never have begun my PhD. Her enthusiasm inspired me to stick with physics a little longer.

Thank you to the staff of the Condensed Matter CDT, who work extremely hard to give myself and others like me this opportunity. I am especially grateful for the generous travel funding! As anyone who has met me since I spent six weeks in California knows, I once got to spend six weeks doing research in California. I often think fondly of my time there, as I look at the wind and rain outside my window in Edinburgh. Special thanks to the present and former administrative staff of both the CDT and Heriot-Watt: Julie, Christine, Wendy, Loraine, and Sheila. It is clear that without them, nothing would ever get done.

Thank you to all my long-suffering friends, colleagues, and flatmates, present and former. All of them have helped me to enjoy Edinburgh so much that I intend to stick around for some time. Especially the lunch crew, Ash, Adam, Stuart, and James, and Darren, who introduced me to climbing. Special thank you to my friend from `back home' James Puddephatt, as he agreed to proofread my thesis in exchange for a bag of haribo. Any mistakes that still remain are certainly my fault, but I will blame him anyway.

Thank you to my grandparents, John ``Jock'' Thomson Brown, Marguerite ``Peggy'' Brown (Scotland Nan), and Brenda Sneade (Telford Nan). Without their generous support, I would never have completed even my undergraduate degree. It seems unlikely I can return the favour, so I must pass it on instead.   

Thank you to my father, Robert Andrew Brown, who first spurred my interest in computers. He is the only person I've ever met who could ramble about nothing for as long as I can. If he could, I'm sure he would read this thesis cover to cover. Finally, to my mother Rosemary Helen Brown, who is strong in ways I cannot imagine: thank you for \emph{everything}.
